        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pad kra pao, a staple in Thai cuisine, is a spicy and savory stir-fry dish featuring ground meat and holy basil. 
        It offers an aromatic blend of spicy, sweet, and garlicky flavors. Typically served over rice with a crispy fried egg,

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground pork</li>
            <li>Thai holy basil</li>
            <li>Flavor seasoning (RosDee)</li>
            <li>Oyster sauce</li>
            <li>Light soy sauce</li>
            <li>Fish sauce</li>
            <li>Chilies</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>White sugar</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roughly crush the garlic and chilies using a mortar and pestle.</li>
            <li>Heat oil over medium-high heat in a wok pan or skillet. 
            Add the crushed chili-garlic paste, stir-fry for 20 seconds, 
            or until the garlic turns golden and the paste becomes fragrant.</li>
            <li>Toss in ground pork and break up any clumps. If youâ€™re comfortable with it, 
            cook over high heat, stirring continuously until the meat is fully cooked through 
            which typically takes about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add oyster sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, light soy sauce, 
            and flavor seasoning. Continue stir-frying until sugar is dissolved 
            and sauces are well mixed.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and toss in holy basil, gently mix and serve.</li>
        </ol>
